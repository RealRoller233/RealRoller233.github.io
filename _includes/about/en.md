hi, I'm RealRoller, an undergraduate student of School of Physics in PKU, who is enthusiastic about technology(maybe hacking?) but knows nothing about it.

My account names on various platforms are almost the same, which is a great opportunity for <del>cyberhunt</del> getting to know me. [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/0000000-58-23), [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/397206206?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0), [Twitter](https://x.com/Real_Roller233), [Github](https://github.com/RealRoller233)

I'm still a newbie, so no posts can be seen.

Thanks to huxpro for the template, which enables a newbie like me to build a personal blog.
